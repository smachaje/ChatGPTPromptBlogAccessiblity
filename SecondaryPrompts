With AI technology at our feet,
Let's embrace it, it's no defeat.
To write prompts, a skill to teach,
Grade them too, it's within our reach.

In the past, accessibility was forgotten,
But now with AI, no one's left out, not even one.
It describes pictures, answers questions,
Aids in comprehension, for all students.

NLP technology remembers context,
For deeper learning, it's a perfect prospect.
Summarizing pages, saving time,
In different formats, like a rhyme.

Legal agreements, no more surprise,
AI technology brings clarity to our eyes.
Captioning videos, prompts for more,
Education for all, that's what we stand for.

Voice assistants and hand-written notes,
AI technology opens new doors and hope.
Code writing for all, a new frontier,
For learners with disabilities, it's crystal clear.

Let's embrace this technology,
For education's inclusivity.
The bicycle for your mind,
AI technology, a true find.
