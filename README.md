Prompt for the blog article: "The Bicycle for Your Mind: How AI Technology is Enhancing Learning for All Students"


Write a blog post in less than 700 words as a global educational community influencer in a warm tone.  You are an expert on web accessibility for educational technology applications. Use this outline:

1. ChatGPT and other generative AI technologies are here to stay, so technophobia should be avoided.  Let's stand on the shoulders on giants and use the new tools.  Let technology be the bicycle for your mind.  One of the most important skills that should be taught in schools soon is the ability to write complex, chained, and informed prompts for AI.  Perhaps we should also grade AI prompts that students use instead of the grading just the essays.

2. Historically innovative technology included accessibility and people with disabilities as an afterthought.  
3. Generative AI can explain to a blind user what is in a picture beyond the required few words in the alt text HTML tag.  More, AI can answer follow-up questions about the picture.  A picture can again say 1000 words to a learner with a visual disability.
4. Generative AI uses NLP to remember the context of previous prompts and build a meaningful conversation.  This allows students with disabilities to dig deeper.
5. While NVDA and Jaws read every word on the page AI can pre-read the contents and then summarize the page in a short or long story.  Students can ask follow-up questions about the contents of the story to significantly speed up their comprehension of the web page.
6. AI can produce the summary in many formats including explanations of the same topic in a different way, or at a grade-school level, or by using a word illustration if prompted.  To make things fun a learner can ask AI to summarize the content in the form of a rhymed poem.  
7. AI can read customer legal agreements and ask if something unexpected is required by the vendor?
8. Students with disabilities can use video captioning or transcript as a prompt to ask follow-up, deeper questions about a video lecture.
9.  When ChatGPT is available through popular voice assistants, the complexities of typing and operating devices manually will be mitigated.
10. ChatGPT-4 can take a hand-written note or picture to create a prompt.  This can take class notes from a friend and build a prompt to ask follow-up questions.  The student with disabilities can ask questions not just about the hand-written notes, but also to help define any new words and have a deep dive into specific new terms.
11.  Generative AI can write computer code, which opens a new door for people with disabilities to translate their ideas into computer-automated artifacts.

Do not use a list in the output. Create paragraphs in a warm tone with flowery language.  Do not use "In conclusion" at the end.
